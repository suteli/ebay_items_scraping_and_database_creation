# eBay Platform Analysis and Database Creation 
I scraped the first 1000+ items for PlayStation4 on eBay, with information including seller name, seller score, item price, number of items sold, best offer available, title, returns allowed, shipping price, condition. I separated the items into sponsored and non-sponsored and wrote the links into two separate text files, and stored the webpages in two separate folders. After obtaining all relevant information by scraping, I imported all data into a MySQL database looked into the key differences between sponsored and non-sponsored items.

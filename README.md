# ebay_items_scraping_and_databasing
I scraped the first 1000 items for PS4 on eBay, with information including seller name, seller score, item price, number of items sold, best offer available, title, returns allowed, shipping price, condition. I separated the items into sponsored and non-sponsored and wrote the links into two separate text files, and stored the webpages in two separate folders. After obtaining all relevant information, I looked into the key differences between sponsored and non-sponsored items.
